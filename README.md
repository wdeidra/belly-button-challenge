# Module 14: Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge

## Overview
This assignment involves creating an **interactive dashboard** to analyze the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs microbial species inhabiting human navels. The dashboard enables users to explore the data dynamically and draw insights into the distribution and prevalence of different microbes.

## Key Insights
- The dataset reveals that only a small group of microbial species, known as **operational taxonomic units (OTUs)**, are common, occurring in over 70% of individuals.
- The majority of microbial species are rare, reflecting unique microbial compositions across different individuals.

## Objective
The goal is to:
1. Build a functional **interactive dashboard** using modern web visualization tools.
2. Highlight meaningful trends and patterns within the dataset.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **JavaScript**: For dashboard interactivity.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the dashboard.
- **Plotly/D3.js**: To create compelling visualizations.
- **Flask**: For developing the web application backend.
